1. Generate Passkey.
1. Claim `APT` token from the faucet.

[The RedEnvelope DappðŸ”—](https://fuzzwallet.vercel.app/redenvelope)

The `Red Envelope` DApp simulates the scenario where a third-party DApp connects to FuzzWallet, allowing users to access their wallets without the need for private keys or mnemonic phrases.

And in cases where the DApp project provides subsidies, users can swiftly enter web3 mode and begin interacting with the world of web3.
