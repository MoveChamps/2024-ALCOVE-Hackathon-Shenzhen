## Introduction
**Quokka DEX** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the ve (3,3) swap protocol, designed to provide users with a secure and efficient cryptocurrency trading experience. As a decentralized exchange, Quokka DEX aims to securely store and facilitate the trading of user assets through smart contracts and a distributed network, while reducing intermediaries and fees associated with transactions.

## Features

### Ve(3,3) Model

The Ve(3,3) model combines the (3,3) game theory model with Curve Finance's voting escrow (ve) token economics. It aims to coordinate incentives for token holders and LPs, encouraging active participation and governance involvement by locking governance tokens. Through locking governance tokens, users can earn more rewards and have a greater impact on protocol governance.

In the Ve(3,3) model, users who lock tokens for longer periods gain more stake, temporarily reducing token supply. Locked tokens used for voting also enable holders to earn trading fees from the pools they vote in, promoting effective allocation of resources and liquidity.
